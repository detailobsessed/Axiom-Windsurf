# iOS Testing Router

**You MUST use this skill for ANY testing-related question, including writing tests, debugging test failures, making tests faster, or choosing between testing approaches.**

## When to Use

Use this router when you encounter:
- Writing new unit tests or UI tests
- Swift Testing framework (@Test, #expect, @Suite)
- XCTest or XCUITest questions
- Making tests run faster (without simulator)
- Flaky tests (pass sometimes, fail sometimes)
- Testing async code reliably
- Migrating from XCTest to Swift Testing
- Test architecture decisions
- Condition-based waiting patterns

## Routing Logic

This router invokes specialized skills based on the specific testing need:

### 1. Unit Tests / Fast Tests → **swift-testing**

**Triggers**:
- Writing new unit tests
- Swift Testing framework (`@Test`, `#expect`, `#require`, `@Suite`)
- Making tests run without simulator
- Testing async code reliably
- `withMainSerialExecutor`, `TestClock`
- Migrating from XCTest
- Parameterized tests
- Tags and traits
- Host Application: None configuration
- Swift Package tests (`swift test`)

**Why swift-testing**: Modern Swift Testing framework with parallel execution, better async support, and the ability to run without launching simulator.

**Invoke**: Read the `swift-testing` skill

---

### 2. UI Tests / XCUITest → **ui-testing**

**Triggers**:
- Recording UI Automation (Xcode 26)
- XCUIApplication, XCUIElement
- Flaky UI tests
- Tests pass locally, fail in CI
- `sleep()` or arbitrary timeouts
- Condition-based waiting
- Cross-device testing
- Accessibility-first testing

**Why ui-testing**: XCUITest requires simulator and has unique patterns for reliability.

**Invoke**: Read the `ui-testing` skill

---

### 3. Flaky Tests / Race Conditions → **test-failure-analyzer** (Agent)

**Triggers**:
- Tests fail randomly in CI
- Tests pass locally but fail in CI
- Flaky tests (pass sometimes, fail sometimes)
- Race conditions in Swift Testing
- Missing `await confirmation` for async callbacks
- Missing `@MainActor` on UI tests
- Shared mutable state in `@Suite`
- Tests pass individually, fail when run together

**Why test-failure-analyzer**: Specialized agent that scans for patterns causing intermittent failures in Swift Testing.

**Invoke**: Launch `test-failure-analyzer` agent

---

### 4. Async Testing Patterns → **testing-async**

**Triggers**:
- Testing async/await functions
- `confirmation` for callbacks (Swift Testing)
- `expectedCount` for multiple callbacks
- Testing MainActor code with `@MainActor @Test`
- Migrating XCTestExpectation → confirmation
- Parallel test execution concerns
- Test timeout configuration

**Why testing-async**: Dedicated patterns for async code in Swift Testing framework.

**Invoke**: Read the `testing-async` skill

---

### 5. Test Crashes / Environment Issues → **xcode-debugging**

**Triggers**:
- Tests crash before assertions run
- Simulator won't boot for tests
- Tests hang indefinitely
- "Unable to boot simulator" errors
- Clean test run differs from incremental

**Why xcode-debugging**: Test failures from environment issues, not test logic.

**Invoke**: Read the `xcode-debugging` skill

## Decision Tree

```
User has testing question
  │
  ├─ Writing unit tests or asking about Swift Testing?
  │  └─ YES → swift-testing
  │
  ├─ Writing UI tests or debugging XCUITest?
  │  └─ YES → ui-testing
  │
  ├─ Testing async/await code patterns?
  │  ├─ confirmation, expectedCount, @MainActor @Test? → testing-async
  │  └─ General async questions? → testing-async
  │
  ├─ Tests fail randomly / flaky in CI / race conditions?
  │  ├─ Check: Uses XCUIApplication/XCUIElement? → ui-testing
  │  └─ Check: Uses @Test/#expect? → test-failure-analyzer (Agent)
  │
  ├─ Tests crash or environment seems wrong?
  │  └─ YES → xcode-debugging (via ios-build)
  │
  └─ Tests are slow, want to speed them up?
     └─ YES → swift-testing (Fast Tests section)
```

## Swift Testing vs XCTest Quick Guide

| Need | Use |
|------|-----|
| Unit tests (logic, models) | Swift Testing |
| UI tests (tap, swipe, assert screens) | XCUITest (XCTest) |
| Tests without simulator | Swift Testing + Package/Framework |
| Parameterized tests | Swift Testing |
| Performance measurements | XCTest (XCTMetric) |
| Objective-C tests | XCTest |

## Anti-Rationalization

**Do NOT skip this router for:**
- "Simple" test questions (proper patterns prevent future pain)
- "I know XCTest" (Swift Testing is significantly better for unit tests)
- "Tests are slow but it's fine" (fast tests enable TDD and better feedback)

**Fast, reliable tests are foundational to code quality.**
