# Liquid Glass Adoption Audit

Launches the **liquid-glass-auditor** agent to scan for Liquid Glass adoption opportunities in your SwiftUI codebase (iOS 26+).

## What It Checks

- Custom views for glass background effects
- Toolbar improvements (missing .borderedProminent, Spacer(.fixed))
- Search pattern opportunities (.searchable() placement)
- Migration from old blur effects (UIBlurEffect, NSVisualEffectView, .material)
- Tinting opportunities for prominent buttons

## Prefer Natural Language?

You can also trigger this agent by saying:
- "Find Liquid Glass adoption opportunities"
- "Check my app for Liquid Glass patterns"
- "I have old UIBlurEffect code, should I migrate?"
