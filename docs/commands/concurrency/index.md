## When to Use Commands vs Skills

**Use a command when**:

- You want a quick automated scan of your code
- You need a roadmap before diving into a skill
- You're looking for specific patterns or issues

**Use a skill when**:

- You want detailed guidance and copy-paste patterns
- You need decision trees and step-by-step help
- You're implementing complex solutions

Commands → get the roadmap → invoke skills for deep work.
