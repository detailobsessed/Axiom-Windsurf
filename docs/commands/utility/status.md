# /axiom:status

Project health dashboard that shows environment status and potential issues at a glance.

## Command

```bash
/axiom:status
```

## What It Checks

### Environment Health

- **Xcodebuild processes**: Detects zombie processes that slow down builds
- **Derived Data**: Checks directory size (warns if > 10GB)
- **Simulators**: Lists booted simulators that consume system resources

### Project Analysis

- **SwiftUI adoption**: Counts views to gauge modernization
- **Memory risks**: Quick scan for raw `Timer` or `NotificationCenter` usage
- **Deployment target**: Verifies minimum supported iOS version

## Example Output

```text
📊 Axiom Project Status
═══════════════════════

🔧 Environment
   Xcodebuild processes: 0
   Derived Data: 2.4GB
   Simulators running: 1 (iPhone 15 Pro)

📱 Project Analysis
   SwiftUI views: 42
   Potential memory patterns: 3 [⚠️]
   Deployment target: iOS 16.0

💡 Suggested Actions
   Based on findings:
   - Run /axiom:audit-memory to check the 3 potential memory patterns
```

## When to Use

- Before starting a debugging session
- When your machine feels slow (check for zombie processes/simulators)
- To get a quick overview of a new codebase
