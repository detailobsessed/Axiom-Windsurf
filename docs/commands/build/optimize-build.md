# /axiom:optimize-build

Scan Xcode project for build performance optimizations (launches the `build-optimizer` agent).

## Command

```bash
/axiom:optimize-build
```

## What It Checks

1. **Build Settings**: Compilation mode, architecture settings, optimization levels
2. **Build Phases**: Scripts running unconditionally (missing input/output files)
3. **Type Checking**: Slow compilation paths in Swift code
4. **Project Structure**: Dependency graph bottlenecks

## Expected Results

- **30-50% faster** incremental debug builds
- **5-10 seconds saved** per build from fixing script phases
- Reduced thermal throttling on your machine

## When to Use

- Incremental builds take > 15 seconds
- "Indexing..." hangs for long periods
- Your fan spins up immediately when building
- You want to audit your project configuration against best practices
