# Performance Profiling

Decision trees to choose the right Instruments tool and interpret results correctly. Covers Time Profiler, Allocations, Core Data, and Energy Impact.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you're:

- App feels slow (UI lags, loads take 5+ seconds)
- Memory grows over time in Xcode memory gauge
- Battery drains fast (device gets hot)
- Unsure which Instruments tool to use
- Profiling results are confusing or contradictory
- Want to profile proactively before users complain

**Core principle:** Measure before optimizing. Guessing wastes more time than profiling.

## Example Prompts

Questions you can ask Claude that will draw from this skill:

- "My app feels slow. Which Instruments tool should I use?"
- "How do I read Time Profiler results? What's the difference between Self Time and Total Time?"
- "Memory keeps growing but I don't see leaks. What's happening?"
- "How do I find N+1 queries with Core Data instrument?"
- "My app drains battery. How do I profile energy usage?"
- "Time Profiler shows a hot spot but fixing it didn't help. What did I miss?"
- "How do I profile a specific user interaction?"

## What's Covered

### Decision Tree

```
App performance problem?
├─ App feels slow or lags
│  └─ → Time Profiler (CPU usage)
├─ Memory grows over time
│  └─ → Allocations (object creation)
├─ Data loading is slow
│  └─ → Core Data instrument (if using Core Data)
├─ Battery drains fast
│  └─ → Energy Impact
└─ Scrolling stutters
   └─ → Time Profiler + SwiftUI Instrument
```

### Time Profiler Deep Dive

- Self Time vs Total Time (critical distinction)
- Call tree navigation
- Identifying hot spots
- Common misinterpretations

### Allocations Deep Dive

- Object creation tracking
- Growth patterns (leak vs cache)
- Heap snapshots
- Mark Generation technique

### Core Data Deep Dive

- N+1 query detection with SQL logging
- Prefetching patterns
- Batch operation optimization

### Energy Impact

- CPU/GPU/Network subsystem analysis
- Background activity auditing
- Location services impact

### Pressure Scenarios

- Deadline pressure handling
- Manager authority pressure
- Misinterpretation prevention

## Key Pattern

### Self Time vs Total Time

```
Self Time: Time spent IN this function (not callees)
Total Time: Time spent in this function AND all callees

Example reading:
┌─────────────────────────────┬──────────┬────────────┐
│ Function                    │ Self Time│ Total Time │
├─────────────────────────────┼──────────┼────────────┤
│ processData()               │ 2ms      │ 500ms      │ ← NOT the problem
│   └─ expensiveSort()        │ 498ms    │ 498ms      │ ← THE problem
└─────────────────────────────┴──────────┴────────────┘

✅ Look at Self Time to find actual bottleneck
❌ Don't optimize processData() based on Total Time alone
```

### Quick Profiling Workflow

1. **Profile on real device** (not simulator)
2. **Record specific interaction** (not just app launch)
3. **Look at Self Time** first
4. **Find 80/20** (20% of code causing 80% of time)
5. **Measure after fix** (verify improvement)
