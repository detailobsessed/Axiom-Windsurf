## Skill Development Methodology

Skills in Axiom are developed using rigorous quality standards:

### TDD-Tested Skills

- **xcode-debugging** – 6 refinements from pressure testing
- **swift-concurrency** – Critical checklist contradiction found and fixed
- **database-migration** – Already bulletproof, validated under pressure
- **swiftdata** – Many-to-many relationships, unfollow patterns, CloudKit corruption recovery added during testing
- **memory-debugging** – PhotoKit leak patterns and non-reproducible issue debugging added during testing

### Reference Skills

All reference skills are reviewed against 4 quality criteria:

1. **Accuracy** – Every claim cited to official sources, code tested
2. **Completeness** – 80%+ coverage, edge cases documented, troubleshooting sections
3. **Clarity** – Examples first, scannable structure, jargon defined
4. **Practical Value** – Copy-paste ready, expert checklists, real-world impact
