- [Memory Debugging](/skills/debugging/memory-debugging) – Systematic leak diagnosis with proven patterns
- [Build Troubleshooting](/skills/debugging/build-troubleshooting) – Dependency resolution for CocoaPods and SPM

### Concurrency & Async

Master Swift's concurrency model and catch data races at compile time with strict concurrency patterns.

- [Swift Concurrency](/skills/concurrency/swift-concurrency) – Swift 6 strict concurrency, async/await, MainActor, Sendable

### Persistence

Comprehensive database patterns for safe schema evolution and choosing the right persistence framework.

- [Database Migration](/skills/persistence/database-migration) – Safe schema evolution for SQLite/GRDB/SwiftData
- [SQLiteData](/skills/persistence/sqlitedata) – Point-Free's SQLiteData patterns and CloudKit sync
- [GRDB](/skills/persistence/grdb) – Raw SQL queries and ValueObservation patterns
- [SwiftData](/skills/persistence/swiftdata) – iOS 26+ features, @Model definitions, and @Query patterns

## Skill Development Methodology

Skills in Axiom are developed using rigorous quality standards:

### TDD-Tested Skills

- **xcode-debugging** – 6 refinements from pressure testing
- **swift-concurrency** – Critical checklist contradiction found and fixed
- **database-migration** – Already bulletproof, validated under pressure
- **swiftdata** – Many-to-many relationships, unfollow patterns, CloudKit corruption recovery added during testing
- **memory-debugging** – PhotoKit leak patterns and non-reproducible issue debugging added during testing
- **ui-testing** – Network conditioning, multi-factor device testing, crash debugging patterns added from App Store review blocker scenario
- **build-troubleshooting** – Authority bias resistance, 4-step push-back framework, and pressure scenario guidance added from production crisis testing
- **liquid-glass** – Design review pressure handling, professional push-back framework, Regular vs Clear variant decision defense patterns added from client-watching design review scenario
- **swiftui-performance** – Production crisis decision-making, 30-minute diagnostic protocol with time-cost analysis, deployment deadline pressure guidance, and 5-question verification framework added from App Store performance blocker scenario
- **swiftui-debugging** – Intermittent update diagnosis (60-minute protocol), App Store Review deadline pressure handling, co-lead authority pressure resistance, and professional push-back scripts added from maximum pressure testing
- **sqlitedata** – StructuredQueries migration crash decision framework, data-loss prevention patterns, emergency mitigation guidance, and honest pressure points analysis added from iOS 26 App Store update failure scenario
- **grdb** – Query profiling guidance (database.trace + EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN), ValueObservation optimization patterns with size-based decisions, and migration versioning guarantees added from complex join query performance testing

### Reference Skills

All reference skills are reviewed against 4 quality criteria:

1. **Accuracy** – Every claim cited to official sources, code tested
2. **Completeness** – 80%+ coverage, edge cases documented, troubleshooting sections
3. **Clarity** – Examples first, scannable structure, jargon defined
4. **Practical Value** – Copy-paste ready, expert checklists, real-world impact
