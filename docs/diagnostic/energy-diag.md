# Energy Diagnostics

Symptom-based troubleshooting for iOS energy issues. Start with your symptom, follow the decision tree, get the fix.

## Symptoms This Diagnoses

Use when you're experiencing:

- App at top of Battery Settings
- Device gets hot during app use
- High background battery drain
- Battery drains faster on cellular than WiFi
- Energy spike during specific action
- "Phone gets hot" user complaints

## Example Prompts

- "My app is at the top of Battery Settings"
- "Users say their phone gets hot when using my app"
- "High background battery drain reported"
- "App drains battery more on cellular than WiFi"
- "Energy spikes when user taps this button"
- "How do I diagnose battery drain?"

## Diagnostic Workflow

Claude guides you through symptom-based diagnosis:

### Symptom 1: App at Top of Battery Settings

**Power Profiler reveals which subsystem:**

- CPU high → Timer leak or polling loop
- Network high → Batching issue or polling
- GPU high → Animations running when not visible
- Display high → Light backgrounds on OLED

### Symptom 2: Device Gets Hot

**During specific action:**

- Video/camera → Check encoding efficiency
- Scroll/animation → Reduce effects, check frame rate
- Data processing → Move to background, cache results

**During normal use:**

- Run Power Profiler to identify continuous drain
- Check for infinite loops or runaway recursion

### Symptom 3: Background Drain

**Check Info.plist background modes:**

- Location → Use significant-change, not continuous
- Audio → Deactivate session when not playing
- Fetch → Reasonable earliestBeginDate
- BGTask → Complete tasks promptly

### Symptom 4: Cellular-Only Drain

**Check URLSession configuration:**

- `allowsExpensiveNetworkAccess` → Set false for non-urgent
- `isDiscretionary` → Set true for background downloads
- Request patterns → Batch small requests

## Quick Diagnostic Checklist

### 30-Second Check

- Device plugged in? (Power metrics show 0)
- Debug build? (Less optimized)
- Low Power Mode on? (Affects measurements)

### 5-Minute Check

- Which subsystem dominant? (CPU/GPU/Network/Display)
- Sustained or spiky?
- Foreground or background?

### Common Quick Fixes

| Finding | Fix | Time |
|---------|-----|------|
| Timer without tolerance | Add `.tolerance = 0.1` | 1 min |
| VStack with large ForEach | Change to LazyVStack | 1 min |
| Missing stopUpdatingLocation | Add stop call | 2 min |
| No Dark Mode | Add asset variants | 30 min |
