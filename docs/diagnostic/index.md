## Quality Standards

Diagnostic skills are reviewed against 4 criteria plus mandatory workflows:

1. **Accuracy** — Every claim cited to official sources, code tested
2. **Completeness** — 80%+ coverage, edge cases documented, troubleshooting sections
3. **Clarity** — Examples first, scannable structure, jargon defined
4. **Practical Value** — Copy-paste ready, expert checklists, real-world impact
5. **Mandatory Workflows** — Required diagnostic steps with pressure scenario defense

Diagnostic skills add pressure scenario defense for production crisis situations.
