# Xcode Debugging

Environment-first diagnostics for mysterious Xcode issues. Prevents 30+ minute rabbit holes by checking build environment before debugging code.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you're:

- Getting BUILD FAILED with no clear error
- Tests passed yesterday, failing today with no code changes
- Build succeeds but old code executes
- Simulator says "Unable to boot" or stuck at splash screen
- Getting "No such module" after SPM updates
- Experiencing intermittent build failures

**Core principle:** 80% of "mysterious" Xcode issues are environment problems (stale Derived Data, stuck simulators, zombie processes), not code bugs.

## Example Prompts

Questions you can ask Claude that will draw from this skill:

- "My build fails with 'BUILD FAILED' but no error details. I haven't changed anything."
- "Tests passed yesterday, failing today with no code changes. What's going on?"
- "My app builds but runs old code from before my changes."
- "Simulator says 'Unable to boot simulator'. How do I recover?"
- "I'm getting 'No such module' errors after updating SPM dependencies."
- "Build sometimes succeeds, sometimes fails. Why?"
- "I have 20 xcodebuild processes running. Is that normal?"

## What's Covered

### Red Flags (Check Environment First)

- "It works on my machine but not CI"
- "Tests passed yesterday, failing today"
- "Build succeeds but old code executes"
- Intermittent success/failure
- Simulator stuck or unresponsive
- Multiple zombie xcodebuild processes

### Environment Diagnostics

- Derived Data state and cleanup
- Simulator health checks with simctl
- Zombie process detection and cleanup
- SPM cache verification

### Recovery Commands

- Safe Derived Data deletion
- Simulator reset and recovery
- Process cleanup without reboot
- SPM cache refresh

### Time Cost Transparency

- 2-5 minutes: Derived Data cleanup
- 5-10 minutes: Full environment reset
- 30+ minutes: Debugging code when problem is environment

## Key Pattern

### The Environment-First Checklist

```bash
# 1. Check for zombie processes (10+ or older than 30 min = problem)
ps aux | grep -E "xcodebuild|Simulator" | grep -v grep

# 2. Kill zombies if found
killall xcodebuild 2>/dev/null
killall Simulator 2>/dev/null

# 3. Clean Derived Data
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData

# 4. Reset simulators if needed
xcrun simctl shutdown all
xcrun simctl erase all  # Nuclear option - erases all simulator data

# 5. Clean SPM cache if module errors persist
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/org.swift.swiftpm
```

### When to Use Each Step

| Symptom | Fix | Time |
| ------- | --- | ---- |
| Stale builds, old code runs | Delete Derived Data | 2 min |
| "No such module" | Delete Derived Data + SPM cache | 3 min |
| Simulator stuck | simctl shutdown + reboot | 2 min |
| Zombie processes | killall | 1 min |
| All of the above | Full reset + reboot | 10 min |

## Documentation Scope

This page documents the `axiom-xcode-debugging` skill—environment-first diagnostics Claude uses before investigating code issues. The skill contains complete command sequences, decision trees, and time-cost analysis.

**For build failures specifically:** Use `/axiom:fix-build` command (Claude Code only) for automated diagnosis and fixes.
