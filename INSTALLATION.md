# Axiom Installation Guide

## Quick Start

### 1. Add the Marketplace

In Claude Code, run:

```
/plugin marketplace add https://charleswiltgen.github.io/Axiom/
```

### 2. Install the Plugin

Use `/plugin` to open the plugin menu, search for "axiom", and click Install.

### 3. Verify Installation

In Claude Code, use `/help` to see installed plugins:

```
/help
# You should see axiom's skills listed
```

## Skills Available

After installation, these skills are automatically available:

- `axiom:xcode-debugging` - Environment-first Xcode diagnostics
- `axiom:swift-concurrency` - Swift 6 concurrency patterns
- `axiom:database-migration` - Safe database schema evolution
- `axiom:memory-debugging` - Memory leak diagnosis
- `axiom:ui-testing` - Reliable XCTest patterns
- `axiom:build-troubleshooting` - Dependency resolution

## Using Skills

Skills are automatically suggested by Claude Code based on context, or you can invoke them manually:

```bash
# When you encounter a build error
/skill axiom:xcode-debugging

# When you see actor isolation errors
/skill axiom:swift-concurrency

# When adding database columns
/skill axiom:database-migration

# When debugging memory leaks
/skill axiom:memory-debugging

# When tests are flaky
/skill axiom:ui-testing

# When dependencies fail to resolve
/skill axiom:build-troubleshooting
```

## Testing the Installation

Try this example:

```bash
# In a Claude Code session:
# "I'm getting BUILD FAILED with no details in Xcode"

# Claude Code should automatically suggest axiom:xcode-debugging
# Or you can invoke it manually:
/skill axiom:xcode-debugging
```
