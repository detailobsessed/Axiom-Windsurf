- New SwiftUI Instrument walkthrough (4 track lanes, color-coding, integration with Time Profiler)
- **Cause & Effect Graph** - Visualize data flow and dependencies to eliminate unnecessary updates
- Problem 1: Long View Body Updates (formatter caching, expensive operations)
- Problem 2: Unnecessary View Updates (granular dependencies, AttributeGraph)
- Performance optimization checklist
- Real-world impact examples from WWDC's Landmarks app

**When to use:** App feels less responsive, animations stutter, scrolling performance issues, profiling reveals SwiftUI bottlenecks

**Requirements:** Xcode 26+, iOS 26+ SDK

---

#### `ui-testing`
Reliable UI testing with condition-based waiting patterns and new Recording UI Automation features from Xcode 26.

**Key Features:**
- **Recording UI Automation** - Record interactions as Swift code, replay across devices/languages/configurations, review video recordings
- Three phases: Record → Replay → Review
- Condition-based waiting (eliminates flaky tests from sleep() timeouts)
- Accessibility-first testing patterns
- SwiftUI and UIKit testing strategies
- Test plans and configurations

**When to use:** Writing UI tests, recording interactions, tests have race conditions or timing dependencies, flaky tests

**Requirements:** Xcode 26+ for Recording UI Automation, original patterns work with earlier versions
